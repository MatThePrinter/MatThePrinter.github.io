      <description>Din Djaarin in Jango&amp;rsquo;s Suit This project was a personal tattoo project to continue my patchwork sleeve.
It represents Din Djaarin, better known as Mando. When the show went out, i immediately identified as him, as most fathers did, i guess.
This mandalorian reference displayed as a fatherly figure and not as a warrior is absolutely intentional. Din Djaarin doesn&amp;rsquo;t bear weapons here, only the space coffin of the child he is devoted to, in a posture that reminds of those of St Mary.</description>

      <description>Imposter syndrome goblin This project was a personal tattoo project to continue my patchwork sleeve. This goblin stands for the imposter syndrome that seem to hit all of us artists
The design is inspired by Saint Barthelemy, depicted as he died : skinned to death, carrying his own skin and the knife of his torturer.
The goblin is a figure of self acceptation: we all are goblins from time to time, ugly, stressed, powerless.</description>
