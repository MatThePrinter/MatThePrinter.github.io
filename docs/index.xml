      <description>Mat the Printer (in pink, with roots) Just a bit of fun to fiddle around with my new graphic tablet. I needed to take something and try to create a multilayer color project.
Technique The technique was unlike every color work i made until then. Instead of coloring the layer below, or stacking the layers in multiply mode, i started to usethe alpha layers and build colored shapes in top of the previous one each time.</description>

      <title>Niveau 1 - Tattoo Flashday</title>

      <description>Level 1 This project was a collab with my favourite local tattoo artist (from Dijon ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·). I was asked to provide a flash sheet, which theme was entirely free. So i went with that old tabletop RPG vibe that i love, inspired mostly by John Blanche, amongst other famous 80&amp;rsquo;s concept artists.
I decided to go with it and create 6 flashes, straight from the players handbook. Each design represents an item, spell or creature any 1st level player could encounter during its journey.</description>

      <description>Din Djaarin in Jango&amp;rsquo;s Suit This project was a personal tattoo project to continue my patchwork sleeve.
It represents Din Djaarin, better known as Mando. When the show went out, i immediately identified as him, as most fathers did, i guess.
This mandalorian reference displayed as a fatherly figure and not as a warrior is absolutely intentional. Din Djaarin doesn&amp;rsquo;t bear weapons here, only the space coffin of the child he is devoted to, in a posture that reminds of those of St Mary.</description>

      <description>Imposter syndrome goblin This project was a personal tattoo project to continue my patchwork sleeve. This goblin stands for the imposter syndrome that seem to hit all of us artists
The design is inspired by Saint Barthelemy, depicted as he died : skinned to death, carrying his own skin and the knife of his torturer.
The goblin is a figure of self acceptation: we all are goblins from time to time, ugly, stressed, powerless.</description>

      <description>Stormtrooper on Tattooine This is an original artwork freely inspired by the XVI century woodcuts. The graphic style tends to imitate the master woodcutters (DÃ¼rer, Egenolff, Wolgemut) of the late XVth century, early XVIth , both in terms of tools, techniques, and the posture and symbolism itself.
The scene represents a Stormtrooper of the Galactic Empire, burning down the huts of poor farmers.
This linocut was deeply inspired by Star Wars, because being a nerd is a good way to be inspired by cool stuff</description>

      <description>Sweet Zombie Jesus This illustration was done under an hour in Krita
This was made out of fun, between 2 and 3 AM instead of going to bed. Every late night drawing begins with &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon, just one last bit&amp;rdquo;. And ends up way to late.
Technique The technique used was, as i like to call it &amp;ldquo;Digital carving &amp;quot; technique. This consists in several succssive steps
Sketching using a pencil brush Put a black layer on top, in high opacity to distinguish the sketch through the canvas With a white brush, or on erasing mode, withdraw the black from the canvas to create the whites.</description>

      <description>The Hog This is an original artwork freely inspired by modern linocuts. Stepping aside from my usual renaissance inspired artworks, i decided to take a shot at a modern design.
The scene represents a wounded hog, pierced by several arrows. The main thing about this linocut was to nail the fur, and the shading of the hairs.
The techniques The sketch was directly drawn on the lino block, then inked with a quill on the block.</description>

      <description>Thornwood Parfums This project was a commission from a NZ brand in the fragrance game. They wanted to develop a strong artwork line, invoking the heavy designs from the gothic medieval era, that i love and try to put forward.
Thornwood wanted 5 woodcuts that evoked a specific mind state. Just as if you could describe an olfactive impression with words. Difficult, innit? Well i did exactly that with feelings and linocut.</description>

I always loved greenskins and history. And when i had the chance to create an artwork that could use both my passions, i jumped on it.
This project was the right occasion to try to tighten the bonds between a medieval motif and a modern approach of it. I wanted to go for the religious effect on the render, as were the woodcuts from the gothic medieval era, at the very first years of XVIth century</description>

      <description>The Dwarwen Brewery This fantastic representation of a dwarven colony-sized booze frenzy was inspired by a XIIIth treatise on beer brewing [available here] This linocut depicts a dwarven brewery, a personal view of this poem.
Mainly because I like dwarves and i think the fantasy kind of dwarf encapsulates perfectly the light spirit that i thought might correspond to this XIIIth brewery. This contains the original verses in old french, describing all the malting and brewing process, to the final step of getting hammered and wanting to forget about it all.</description>

      <description>The technique The sketch was originally drawn on transparent paper, then reported on the lino block, then inked on the block. Once dried out, the block was carved with gouges: the linocut process itself. This process was particularly long, due to the massive amount of texts that is included in the orginal poem.
This was one of my earliest projects, one of my biggest occasions to learn and do mistakes. My skill level when i started was nothing close to the one i had when i finished it.</description>

      <description>Ma dÃ©marche artistique La gravure sâ€™inscrit la croisÃ©e entre le courant mÃ©diÃ©val du gothique international, et lâ€™art de la renaissance, qui participe de lâ€™entreprise humaniste au sens philosophique.
Il est intÃ©ressant de noter que certains codes Ã©taient respectÃ©s du fait de la contrainte du medium (le bois) et dâ€™autres, par convention culturelle. Aujourdâ€™hui, les moyens techniques mis en place me permettent de surmonter ces contraintes aussi bien culturelles, que techniques.</description>

      <description>Personal Art Manifesto ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ From my perspective, I see woodcut taking its roots in two artistic movements: the first being international gothic art, and the second renaissance art, which intrinsincly conveys the humanistic values of that period of time.
It&amp;rsquo;s more than interesting to notice that graphic conventions were directly dictated by the medium employed (wood for the blocks) as other were dictated by graphic and societal conventions. As of today, the technical means that i dispose of allow me to pass through all of it and overcome both cultural and technical obstacles.</description>
