## Imposter syndrome goblin 

This project was a personal tattoo project to continue my patchwork sleeve. This goblin stands for the imposter syndrome that seem to hit all of us artists

The design is inspired by **Saint Barthelemy**, depicted as he died : skinned to death, carrying his own skin and the knife of his torturer.

The goblin is a figure of **self acceptation**: we all are goblins from time to time, ugly, stressed, powerless. There is a goblin archetype called a skin thief, which steals skins to disguise himself as someone else, and hide from danger or infiltrate somewhere. This goblin helps me to keep all of this in mind:
1. **In both cases no one will ever notice you don't fit and you're an imposter**. Either you're too good a skinthief, or too good at your job. 
2. When you're making mistakes, ***be proud of the goblin within you**: it is learning
3. Someday you won't need the goblin skinthief anymore : it means it's time to move on to something new to learn, and be a skinthief somewhere else

*This was meant to be inked on my own skin, it's a personal piece, meant to be kept unique. But if you wznt one of yours, please get in touch with me and i'll see what i can do to best fit your request*
