## Din Djaarin in Jango's Suit

This project was a personal tattoo project to continue my patchwork sleeve.


It represents Din Djaarin, better known as Mando. When the show went out, i immediately identified as him, as most fathers did, i guess.

This mandalorian reference displayed as a fatherly figure and not as a warrior is absolutely intentional. Din Djaarin doesn't bear weapons here, only the space coffin of the child he is devoted to, in a posture that reminds of those of **St Mary**. I didn't want him to be depicted as the allmighty warrior he certainly is, but as a **loving figure of masculinity**, which is certainly a lacking role model in the contemporary masculine representation. 

*This was meant to be inked on my own skin, it's a personal piece, meant to be kept unique. But if you wznt one of yours, please get in touch with me and i'll see what i can do to best fit your request*
