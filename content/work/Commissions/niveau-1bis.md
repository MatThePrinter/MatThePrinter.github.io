## Level 1

This project was a collab with my favourite local tattoo artist (from Dijon ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·). I was asked to provide a **flash sheet**, which theme was entirely free. So i went with that **old tabletop RPG** vibe that i love, inspired mostly by John Blanche, amongst other famous 80's concept artists.

I decided to go with it and create 6 flashes, straight from the players handbook. Each design represents an item, spell or creature any 1st level player could encounter during its journey. Of course, keeping in mind i can continue and produce a Level 2 in case of success.


## The technique 

The **sketches** was originally drawn on transparent paper, then reported on the lino block, then **inked with** on the block. Once dried out, the block was **carved with gouges**: the linocut 

To print out something, the carved block was **inked with a brayer and printing ink** and the sheet of paper was **pressed** using a printing linocut press.

Then, it was all digitalised to add some more details, correct the symmetry and be sure to provide the best tattoo material possible.

*This was the first tattoo project that was not meant to be inked on my own skin, which would be followed by 3 more projects. I can't believe how many people want my designs on their skin so badly*
